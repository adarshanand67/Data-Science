1.2 About you and your community
- Briefly introduce yourself and your community.

I am Adarsh Anand, Sophmore at Indian Institute of Technology Goa, an amateur problem-solver, Competitive coder who also explores Data Science and Machine Learning. Most of my works are often backed by data, and I take interest in uncovering patterns, building analogies among diverse datasets. I am the core member of two clubs in my college, namely Google Developer Student Clubs(GDSC) and Gomyno(Programming Club). Speaking about my hobbies - I love to hit the Gym 6 times a week , binging top IMDB movies and have genuine, honest, deep conversations.

Precisely one year ago, when I was a fresher in college, I had no picture of what coding is about. The colleges were online, and I could not interact with my peers and seniors. Due to this, I had to face multiple problems and issues while decoding bugs and much demotivation while coding. As soon as the first year concluded, I was left with very few skills. I wanted to enhance myself and learn more skills when I came into the second year. Juniors have arrived in my college, and I wish they should not suffer the same way. To tackle all these issues, I, along with a few of my friends, created a small community known as OPOC where we would take frequent sessions on different Technologies and answer queries and hold contests to keep our freshers motivated in their technical domains.

- Why do you want to become a GitHub Campus Expert?

I faced many problems in my first year wrt coding - what language should I learn first, which field should I go to? DSA vs Dev?, How to balance College Assignments with coding? Should I study DS/ML/DL after learning Python or master C++ and do DSA+Competitive coding? What platforms to choose from? Web vs Android dev? Should I learn Java/ Kotlin and move to Android development or Cross-Platform Flutter Dev? Should I invest in hot trends like crypto and the stock market? These things confused me, and I lacked consistency while mastering one topic. It is critical to decide which career path you want to achieve in your four years of college life.

By being a GitHub campus expert, I will try to settle all these common issues. As a campus expert, I will help my community make better decisions about the career they want to pursue. I will connect all those people who have similar interests into one bunch. From time to time, I will also hold frequent coding sessions, webinars, workshops, hackathons, and kaggle contests to rejuvenate the local community's enthusiasm. My primary motivation to be a campus expert is to interact with all the great campus experts all around the globe, which will improve my contacts and help me get a job offer. During many other programs, I collaborated with many peers from different universities. Hopefully, I can create more additional contacts and augment my network via this program.

- How will the Campus Experts program enable you to support your local community better?

A brief background about my local community: My college is the Indian Institute of Technology Goa, an extremely new University founded in 2016. There haven't been many Technical improvements and innovations. There is a lack of technical understanding among college students. The college strength is inadequate, with just 150 people in my year. So the task to improve the scenario seems daunting, right?. Well, to solve it step by step, I will, first of all, let all community members explore whatever field they want to try out. If, specifically, they're doing the field of data science and ML, then I would be ready to collaborate with them. Also, I've mentioned the OPOC community, where different people have different tech stacks, which can help nurture the newbies. The GitHub developer student packet will also be handy in learning other skills, whether be it Canva designing or some cloud hosting platforms or domain names. I have myself used many of their products and found them beneficial. I didn't even know that there existed such a thing until I joined my second year. Introducing getting Git, Github and GitHub developer students to the community will boost their current learning rate and help them deliver products faster.
